<h2>The API economy</h2>

<p>What do Twitter, Airbnb, Facebook, PayPal and stripe share in common. Well
all of them drive their core operations on internet platforms and have massively
high valuations with very few actual physical assets. Also these companies
excel at using api's to drive competitive advantage. API's are a
technology that allows firms to interact and share information with other firms
at an unprecedented scale taking advantage of the far-reaching progress
in digitalization in the world and also the rising influence of software in our
day to day lives the opportunities for competitive advantage are now becoming
available to all companies. Every organization can use customer
interaction points to collect information using software systems. Now
many organizations already do this but they do not recognize its full potential
for example they frequently choose to use that information purely as an
internal asset and seldom allow third parties to build complimentary services
on top of their data.The adoption of api's is changing and that the trend of
using data only internally has changed to opening new avenues for building
advantage and pursuing growth. The arrival of API management in companies
such as apigee has hastened this adoption. API represent the future of
consumer and community engagement and its implications are much broader than
the traditional web-based business models.There are more than 15,000 api is
offered by firms today according to programmableweb.com
currently salesforce.com generates 50% of its revenue through api's, expedia.com
generates 90% and ebay 60% salesforce.com has a marketplace called
app exchange for apps created by its partners that work on its platform they
now number more than 300 and growing Expedia's api's allow people using
third-party websites they allow them to tap into its functionality in order to
book flights, cars and hotels and API's allow eBay to list its auctions on other
websites to get better information about sold items, to collect feedback on
transactions and lists new items for sale. All of which give additional
exposure to eBay items and increase revenue so these
trends are only going to become more widespread. Early adopters will be able
to significantly expand the revenues by discovering and joining force with other
complementers. Take Twitter as an example. In its early days its user interface was
not good enough for regular users. As a result it floundered for a while then
TweetDeck a third-party developer built a better user interface on top of the
Twitter engine this ultimately led to an explosion in Twitter usage and
inevitably Twitter then acquired TweetDeck in 2011. Google didn't consider
Google Maps to be a core asset until a third-party application allowed Google
Maps to show real estate locations on a map
this caused the popularity to skyrocket Google now is expanded API access to
Google Maps and several of its other products api's allows firms to expand
into markets they may never have previously considered. Take the case of
IBM's Watson a cognitive computing technology that allows humans to make
sense of large volumes of data. In the old days
IBM would have opted to keep all that information in-house but recognizing
that the world had changed IBM opened access to Watson through
api's to the entire world. Now IBM expects this move will allow it
to attract an extraordinary range of ideas and inputs from all kinds of
third-party firms and develop an unprecedented range of new services. So
more and more company products are now almost solely based and comprised of
other people's api's. Uber is a perfect example. It didn't have to build its own
mapping, payment, or communication services Instead Uber is a composite of
various applications; Google Maps, Braintree for payment, Twilio for SMS,
Oracle and others. Uber was quickly able to connect all of these systems using a
little piece of codes called api's and in effect build a brand new product
almost entirely consisting of other people's products and a little clever
thinking

<h2>why build an API</h2>
<p>So why might you need to build an API Well sometimes savvy customers or
partners ask if you have an API to help make a technical integration with your
software easier or even possible. Organizations like Silver pop an email
marketing company found that once the largest companies in the world started
using its product these companies wanted tight integration of email marketing
capabilities and other marketing automation applications. The obvious
solution for this integration was an API. Getting images for example a photo
Licensing firm had customers who wanted to bypass the firm's website and
integrate photos for licensing in their publishing and production applications
the obvious solution there again was also an API. Some companies such as
stripe and PayPal only offer API access as a means of using their software other
than accessing their account administration website. This is because
the product is designed only to be accessed from other applications. But not
all api's are used by external customers. Large companies with many teams and
divisions now use API is to communicate between and within their internal
systems. As far back as 2002 Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon issued the
following mandate. All teams will henceforth expose their data and
functionality to service interfaces. Teams must communicate with each other
through these interfaces. There will be no other form of inter process
communication allowed no direct linking no direct reads of another team's data
store no shared memory model no backdoors whatsoever the only
communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network. It
doesn't matter what technology they use (great for developers) this is really
important. A company can buy or team up with another company's product whose
tech stack is completely different . No compatibility issues
like in the old days no massive internal dev language retraining api's allow it
to neatly integrate with the existing composite ecosystem no more rigid
monolithic systems that don't talk to anyone else. Anyway, so he also said that
all service interfaces without exception must be
designed from the ground up to be externalisable that is to say the
team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in
the outside world no exception the mandate goes with anybody who doesn't do
this will be fired thank you and have a nice day
so Bezos defined only the outcome of department systems and their deployments
these platforms became a network of business units that were integrated to
the flow of data and information the API model works for all stakeholders in that
organization from a software architecture perspective these loosely
coupled systems data and software became reusable across apps and departments
from business perspective Amazon gained the agility to launch into new business
domains at will because new business units could be quickly and easily
integrated with the existing ecosystem so what are the reasons are there to
build an API. Well you want to drive innovation there was a time when api's
were really the sole concern of the IT departments because they were primarily
viewed as standard interfaces to interact with hardware and software. This
is no longer the case. Modern api offered a simplified
interface to access valuable business data and functionality to the internet
standards that developers understand. As a result new ways of combining and
reusing data and services can produce innovative and are unexpected lines of
business. You also may need to build a new API because you want more
flexibility in providing content for example so the ultimate reason for
offering an API is to provide content or services in a flexible way that's what
websites were and still are. When companies first looked at new ways to
distribute their content beyond the website many turned to method like RSS
feeds but neither websites or RSS feeds are
enough to handle the flexibility that most companies demand these days. API
provide the most flexibility for providing content when and how you want
to under your terms and with better control when meeting your
users needs. You also might have data to make available through open data
strategies government agencies such as the Central Statistics Office and data
gov.ie in Ireland and their international counterparts they all
collect massive amounts of freely available data that it
may not have the time and the resources to use extensively these datasets
include everything from city bike usage the statistical health of the economy
to a countrywide list of monuments for example most of this data is available
to api's your organization may have something similar to offer to society
but the same model works inside companies when a department has an
important database that it does not have time to fully use and explore a private
API can allow other database to leverage that data. What also what if your
competitors have an API. Well when one company in an industry publishes an API
it's quite common for the rest of the industry to follow suit. We saw this when
discussing our insurance quote earlier but in this case all the end users in a
market are in effect requesting an API I've been in the industry sectors like
retail media social network they're all effectively in an arms race with respect
to their api's they're constantly trying to improve them and outdo the
competition. You also may want to let potential partners access your data
so potential partners might want to test the waters in terms what services you
offer before formalizing your relationships an API allows them to
experiment with your offering and determine how much mutual benefit there
is to be had from the pairing. What if you want to scale integration with
customers and partners . Again having an API provides a simpler and more flexible
way to integrate with high-volume customers and partners. Customers who
have a choice of vendors are attracted to companies that are set up to succeed
quickly .An API sends the message that you're in such a position
</p>
<h2>api types</h2>
<p>Okay, so there's three types of APIs. The first one is a private or an internal
API that runs on an intranet within an organization so companies use private
API's to make internal functions of a business run more smoothly and
accelerate innovation. In the Amazon model, humans made their technology
selections as close to the user as possible with the mandate that those
systems the data and the workflow are accessible to all other departments via
a well-documented API. The second type of API is a partner API use on an extranet
so many companies will offer partner API's that are open beyond the
organization. The services are not entirely exposed publicly and they do
retain some security and data control but business-to-business relationships
can produce large revenue and mutually beneficial data exchanges by spreading
assets between each other. So this can be done without too much strain
on internal resources. So finally we've got a public API that runs on the
intranet so companies use public API to selectively expose the very same
services, content or data that a company uses itself this is motivated by an
understanding that the platform can ultimately offer something of value to
those outside the organization. A mark of a successful public API is that it's an
ability to inspire and cultivate apps from new found developer
communities that expand the brand the distribution and the revenue
opportunities. The faster the data can be accessed and processed the faster its
value can be extracted and gained
</p>

<h2> API Business Models </h2>

<p>okay so there's a number of common business models for exposing an API
which model is appropriate for a given API depends on the goals of the a
API provider which may include monetization, brand awareness, business
relationships and making available data that's beneficial to society as a whole
these models include but are not limited to free API's, the developer pays API,
developer gets paid and indirect. Okay so let's have a look at free first so free
API's are available for consumption at no charge such as the API's for popular
social networks like Facebook. Free API's can drive adoption of other API's
and brand loyalty as well as allowing the API provider to enter in new
channels so while there's usually no direct business benefit gained from
exposing free API's the majority of examples do have an indirect business
benefit so, for example, Google exposed their fonts API to developers they also
have their analytics to check productivity and web and they also make
their translate and geocoding apps available for free
Facebook exposes the API's there are hundreds of government API's across the
world that are available to help society as a whole Another model is the developer
pays so in this model developers pay for usage to drive their own
business ventures. It can be seen as a cost of doing business This can be
broken down into additional subcategories actually so what are they
so one subcategory is pay as you go. Pricing is determined by metered usage and in
this model, for example, a cloud computing platforms usage price could be
determined by the number of servers and services used on an hourly basis
Amazon's message is pay only for what you use there's no minimum fee if you
use to the Amazon cloud computing so tiered developers sign up
to and pay for a particular usage tier based on the number of API calls over a
fixed period while the cost increases per tier the cost of the API
call usually drops so the more volume we use the cheaper it
gets so this works similar to how mobile for invoice plans work so where the
level of phone calls determine the call per charge
MailChimp for example the popular mail also use this model. Useage based is
another model where the pricing is determined by consuming units of measure
such as API calls, for example, a cloud storage company could charge per
gigabyte of usage per month another model is a transaction fee where the
pricing is dependent on the value of the transaction
for example electronic money transfer company could charge a percentage of the
transaction as their fee for providing payment services stripe uses this you
also, have freemium where the API offers the basics for free with charges for the
extra stuff.  There has generally what's called rate limiting twitter does it
Google Maps do it and many other more API's do it as well so in this model
companies offer developers some of their API capabilities for free then charge
for additional functionality so for example Twitter allows a certain number
of calls to its API before the service is locked for 15 minutes this access is
useful for development purposes and allows you to create a proof of concept
before maybe upgrading to paid access so what else we got and we also have
developer gets paid model now in this model it has its origins in e-commerce
and advertising so the developer is paid per click for example comparison sites
make revenue every time they redirect to your web site eBay does it Amazon does
evolve very successfully the third party's so in this model the developer
receives payment for extending the business model of others there are two
major categories for this model so one is revenue sharing where developers
receives a small percentage of the total revenue based on a business agreement
with the provider, for example, a mobile application store could charge
developers a yearly subscription while the developer receives a percentage of
sales revenue for their applications another approach
is affiliate where developers receive scaling revenue either percentage based
fixed price or tiered scale based on extending partner platforms for example
a shopping price comparison service could pay developers a small portion of
revenue based on the volume of revenue their API generates
