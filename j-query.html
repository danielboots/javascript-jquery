<p>An introduction to jQuery
Up until now, you have been coding in JavaScript, which is the coding language of the web.
When you interact with a web page or see anything beyond a basic CSS animation, it is done with JavaScript.
However, a relatively simple animation will have a long complex piece of JavaScript code.
The most commonly used web events or animations have all been coded and placed in libraries.
The most widely used of those libraries is jQuery.
With jQuery, you call a jQuery method with one line of code that has many lines of JavaScript wrapped within it.
So in a bootcamp environment, using libraries is a quick way of getting interactive, visually rich web pages.
So within this lesson, we will cover linking to the jQuery library, using selectors, changing HTML CSS, and writing scripts.
This will allow you to make interactive buttons to show and hide elements, highlight elements, and update the contents of elements.
The learning outcomes are: find HTML elements, change their CSS, change their content, listen to user interaction, and respond to user interaction.

<h2>what is JQuery</h2>
<p> jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more."
JavaScript is the language of the web.
It interacts with HTML source code and can be used to create interactive effects within web browsers.
However, JavaScript can be a little complicated and tricky to pick up, especially for beginners.
It can take a while to become familiar with its intricacies.
Although there are more lines of code written in JavaScript than in any other language, it is rarely used to teach programming for beginners due to its complexities.
This is where jQuery comes in.
jQuery makes it easier to use JavaScript on your website by taking common tasks that require many lines of code and wrapping them up so as to create a single line of less complex code.
jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today by far.
It may seem a little strange to learn how to use a library instead of the language itself, but in the case of jQuery, there are some good reasons for this.
jQuery is cross browser compatible.
It also has simpler syntax than JavaScript and provides a great introduction to web coding.
So what will we use jQuery for?
Here's an example of an accordion, which is something we can make with jQuery.
We can show and hide elements, highlight elements, and update the contents of elements.
So in order to do these tasks, we need to learn how to find the HTML elements, change their CSS, change their content, listen to user interaction, and respond to user interaction.
To download jQuery, we can go to the download tab here.
In order to use jQuery in your webpage, you must include the jQuery.js file in between the <head> tags of your web page.
There are a few versions to choose from.
You should choose the latest, uncompressed development version for use with this lesson.
So you can download that file now.
There's another technique that many developers use today.
Instead of hosting the jQuery source code on your own server, you can link to it remotely using a CDN.
A CDN is a content delivery network.
There is an advantage to using this method in that there is a good chance your browser already has the jQuery cached, so it does not need to download it again.
All you need to do is just copy this script tag and put it in the <head> tag of your webpage.
The downside, of course, is if you have no internet access, you have no jQuery available.
So again, if you want the script tags, you just copy the uncompressed version.
The other thing we'll need for this lesson are some pre-prepared HTML files.
So you can download them here.
And we will be using these in the upcoming units to see how to change HTML and add to HTML.

<h2>JQuery Selectors</h2>

<iframe width="758" height="426" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H8C9iyndE9Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Selectors and jQuery work in a very similar fashion to CSS selectors.
We can select elements by type, ID, class, and many more which we will look at during this lesson.
Let's start by opening the sample site in the lesson folder.
Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the code.
jQuery is usually written in a separate file to the HTML and then linked, like an external CSS file.
However, you can also use Chrome developer tools to write jQuery statements direct in the browser.
So we're going to give that a try.
The element selector in jQuery selects all elements that have the same element tag name.
This can be useful for applying a style to a particular group of elements, for example, all divs or all links which are <anchor> tags.
So just as in CSS, as you would link all style elements with a curly bracket,"{}", we can do the same in jQuery.
So let's open Chrome developer tools and click on "Console".
Here we can type commands direct into the console.
For example, we can start with $("a").
And what that does is that would select all anchor link elements.
This is analogous to the {"a"} in CSS.
The dollar symbol is shorthand for the word jQuery.
So we could equally have written it like this: jQuery("a")
However, let's stick to the shorthand and use the $.
To use a class element, we would use dot notation, similar to CSS.
Here, we are selecting all ".card_image" class elements.
To select an element using its ID, we use the #.
Let's select the logoNav ID.
jQuery allows you to traverse the DOM tree and select elements based on their parent element.
There are two variations.
The first variation will only match elements which are direct child to parent elements.
So here, we are returning all anchor link children that are direct children of a <p> element.
The second variation will match all descendents of the parent, i.e. children, and everything below.
For the selector to return all descendents of a parent, regardless of whether directly related or not, we use the following syntax: ("p a").
In this case, there are no anchor children of paragraph parents, so we will look at other elements.
Here, we have "ul" as the parent and "li" as the child: ("ul>li").
Here, it gives a list of all those <li> elements.
If we want to give all <li> elements, regardless of whether directly related or not, we use this syntax: ("ul li").
Pseudo selectors can also be used, just as they were in CSS.
This will select the first anchor on the page: ("a:first").
And this will get the last anchor on the page: ("a:last").
And here, we can select all of the <h> elements on the page, h1s, h2s, h3s, and so on: ("header").
Now that you've seen the syntax, go to the challenge, and use this technique to select various items from this webpage.</p>


<h3>Using JQuery like you select CSS </h3>

<p> note: $ is just short hand for $ JQuery - you can use either or</p>
<pre>
$( '#header' ); // select the element with an ID of 'header'
$( 'li' );      // select all list items on the page
$( 'ul li' );   // select list items that are in unordered lists
$( '.person' ); // select all elements with a class of 'person'
</pre>


<h2>Changing HTML/CSS With JQuery</h2>

<iframe width="758" height="426" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAYbk82fG2Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> Changing HTML or CSS with jQuery
Selecting is wonderful, but what we really want to do is change our selections, such as colors and fonts, or perhaps make them disappear.
There are a number of ways to change the properties of an element.
One of these ways is to modify the CSS using a function.
The function we will look at is the ".CSS" function.
There are two ways to use this function.
We can query a style property or set the style property.
To query a style property, we pass in the property to the function as shown here.
Here, we see the background color is white.
Let's have a look at the font.
And the font is Roboto with the back up font of sans-serif.
So this queries the CSS of any element.
However, if we want to change the CSS of any element, we add in a second parameter with a comma to separate the two.
So this will change the color of the font of any LI element to red.
And there we go. They've changed to red.
Let's try this with another element, in this case an H2.
We're going to change the text-decoration to underline.
And we can see HTML, MySQL, and Python are now all underlined.
We can actually see this using the chrome developer tools.
You can see the inline style of color red has been added to each <li> element, and each H2 has "text-decoration:underline" added as an inline style.
Remember that we don't like using inline styles, as it mixes content and styling on the same section of a page.
Content and styling should be separated in their own sections wherever possible, and we will do this in future lessons.
So let's try another example here.
I'm going to add a border to the ul>element.
This border will be solid, 1px
And we see now that our lists have a 1px border around them.
So what about changing HTML content with jQuery?
So like the ".CSS" function, there is also an HTML function which can retrieve an element's HTML.
That is the ".HTML" function.
So we use it as follows.
Here, we will retrieve all the HTML from "#my_footer".
We can see there we have a paragraph with copyright information written as text.
Let's try this for the whole body of the HTML document.
And there we have all the HTML from the entire webpage.
So just as we were able to replace CSS, we can also replace HTML.
We can even place tags inside the new HTML, for example an H1.
The paragraph that had been there previously is now overwritten with an H1.
If we just wanted to replace the text content of an element, we would use the ".text" function.
Now that  is just replaced by text.
So jQuery is very powerful at manipulating elements.
So we can change the content and style of an entire webpage.
We can also insert new elements by adding them to the DOM, or removing elements from the DOM.
So using the ".append" method, we can add content onto the end of an existing selected HTML element.
So if there was an element with the ID "myElement", this paragraph will be appended on the end.
Let's try that with the "my_footer".
We will append copyright 2017 on to the end of the text that we've previously put in that "my_footer" ID.
And you can see it appears there at the top right of the page.
There are also methods, for example, to remove and empty, which can be used to remove stuff from the page.
So now if you go to the challenge, you can try some of these methods.
 </p>

<h2>jQuery Selectors</h2>

<pre> $('Element').html('HTML element');</pre>
<pre> $('Element').text('Text element');</pre>

<pre> $('Element').append('HTML to append');</pre>


<h3>CSS</h3>

<h3>to find the value of a css element</h3>
<pre> $('h1,li, ul etc').css('background-color',);</pre>

<h3>to change a css element</h3>
<pre> $('h1,li, ul etc').css('color', 'red');</pre>


<h3>Class and ID </h3>
<p>work the same way we use use the css selectors, for example</p>

<pre>
$('#my_ID').css('change-attribute', 'to-this'); 
</pre>


<h2>target the paragraphs challenge</h2>
<p>solution</p>

<pre>$("p").text("All Changed");</pre>

<h2>getter and setter challenge</h2>

<pre>$('p').append('<span>This is appended span code</span>'); // append a span
$('a').remove(); // target all anchors and remove.
$('div.module-2').empty(); // target all divs with a class of .module-2 and empty.
</pre>

<h2>jQuery challenge 3 -</h2>

<pre>
let fontFamily = $("p").css("font-family");
$("h1").text(fontFamily);
$(".card-panel").css("background-color", "green");

</pre>


<h2>writing our first jQuery Script</h2>
<p>Putting jQuery code in a script in a js file

</p>

<p>Write your jQuery code in a .js file and add a script tag in html referencing it below the script tag referencing jQuery</p>

<h2>Add odd and even classes</h2>
<p>solution</p>
<pre>$('tr:odd').addClass('odd');
$('tr:even').addClass('even');</pre>

<p>what this does is take table odds and evens and applies the class to them</p>
